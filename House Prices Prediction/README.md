# üè° House Prices Prediction

This is a self-learning project to make analysis from the house price dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Modelling & Training, and Prediction.

## Background
The house market is a dynamic sector where accurate price estimation plays a crucial role for buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors alike. Predicting house prices using data science techniques allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding property valuation, investment planning, and market strategy. With the increasing availability of structured housing data that includes features such as location, building size, number of rooms, and neighborhood quality, the process of estimating property values can now be automated and optimized. These predictive system play an important role in improving transparency, reducing speculation, and increasing efficiency in the housing market.

Beyond the practical applications in real estate, the structure and richness of housing datasets make them especially interesting from a data science perspective. Unlike many other types of data, housing data often involve both numerical and categorical variables, spatial components, and economic factors, providing a diverse set of challenges for modeling. Moreover, these datasets reflect broader socio-economic patterns within cities and regions, offering insights into urban development and inequality. As such, building predictive models for house prices is not only useful in practice but also offers a compelling case study in the application of technique and future engineering.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). It contains 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of redential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is devide into a training set, which includes both features and the target variable (SalePrice), and the test set, where the target variables is withheld for prediction purposes.
