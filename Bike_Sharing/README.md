# Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics

This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Data Visualization. I also make the dashboard using Streamlit as you can check in [here].
