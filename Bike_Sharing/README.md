# 🚲 Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics

This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Cleaning Data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Data Visualization.

## Background

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

## Dataset

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nizma123/My_Portfolio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Bike_Sharing
   ```
3. Install depedencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```
5. To run the dashboard on local, execute the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
   ```

## Project Work Cycle
1. Data Wrangling:
   * Gathering data
   * Assessing data
   * Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * Define business question for data exploration
   * Create data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
   * Create data visualization that answer business question
4. Dashboard:
   * Set up dataframe which will be used
   * Make filter components on the dashboard
   * Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations
