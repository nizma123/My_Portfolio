## üìÇ Projects

|Project|Associated|Area|Tools|Project Description|
|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
|ü§ñ[SIGNIFY:Belajar Bahasa Isyarat](https://github.com/nizma123/Signify-ML)|MSIB - Bangkit Academy 2023 Batch 2: Capstone Project|Dataset Collection, Data Preprocessing, Modelling & Training, Deployment, Supervised Learning - **Classification**|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV|Developed a gesture recognition to learn basic sign language using machine learning. Used OpenCV for image preprocessing and **CNN** for image processing. The best model achieved an accuracy of 96% using Keras InceptionV3. The project provides lerning resources equipped with features such as several exercises that can help to understand and learn the basic of sign language more effectively.|
|üß¨[Evacuation Route Determination For High-Rise Buildings Using NSGA-II](https://github.com/nizma123/EvacuationRouteDeterminationForHighRiseBuildingsUsingNSGA-II)|Undergraduate Thesis - Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia|Graph Theory, Multiobjective Optimization, Mathematical Modeling|Python, NetworkX, matplotlib, numpy, NSGA-II custom implementation|Developed a **multiobjective optimization model** using NSGA-II to determine evacuation routes in a high-rise building. The model minimizes total evacuation time and total congestion using graph based theory. Routes were optimized based on real building data and visualized as Pareto optimal solution. The insights support safer evacuation planning by giving alternatives solution, potentially saving lives in real emergency scenarios.|
|üö≤ [Bike-Sharing Rentals](https://github.com/nizma123/Bike-Sharing)|Dicoding - Data Analytics|Data Wrangling, EDA, Data Visualization, **Dashboard**|numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Streamlit|Analyzing a bike-sharing rental to uncover patterns in user behavior and rental trends. This project explores how various factors such as weather, season, precipitation, day of week, hour of day affect rental demand. Conducted a data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights. Visualized insights about the user demographics on a dashboard using Streamlit. The result can help bike-sharing companies optimize fleet management and improve customer experience.|
|üè° [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/nizma123/House-Prices-Prediction)|Data Science Self-learning Project|Data Wrangling, EDA, Modelling & Evaluation, **Supervised Learning - Regression**|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, linear regression|Built a regression model to predict house prices based on various features from the housing dataset. Conduct through data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Performed EDA to uncover data patterns and correlations. Implemented **Linear Regression** algorithm for predictive models. The projects provides insights into key factors to support decision making in the real estate market.|
